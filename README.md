# PriorityQueue

This project attempts to create a Priority Queue in Java using a Pair element of Priority and Values Pair<P,E>.

This priority queue is constructed with a min-heap structure and locations are mapped to a Hashmap.

Testing code is provided in the `/PriorityQueueStarter/src/PriorityQueueTest.java` file. I performed JUnit testing in Visual Studio Code. Anyone may clone this project and add additional testing code to further improve the code.
